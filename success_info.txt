Congratulations!

Your automated service provider configuration was successful.  The next step is
to register your service provider in Federation Registry.  To do this, please
follow the steps here:

http://wiki.aaf.edu.au/tech-info/sp-install-guide#TOC-Federation-membership

NOTE: Step 4 has been completed for you already.

When creating your service provider record in Federation Registry, you will be 
asked for your service provider's SSL certificate.  Please cut and paste the
*entire* contents of the file:

/etc/shibboleth/sp-cert.pem

Into the online form.

Once you have submitted the service provider creation online form, please allow
some time for your submission to be approved and the metadata to propagate from
Federation Registry to your service provider and to the identity providers in
the federation.

If you experience any problems at any stage in the process, please contact:

support@aaf.edu.au

Thanks,

The AAF technical team.
